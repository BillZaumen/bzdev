      <H2>Introduction</H2>
    <P>
      B&eacute;zier paths, as used in practice, consist of multiple
      segments, each of which is either a straight-line segment, a
      quadratic B&eacute;zier curve segment, or a cubic B&eacute;zier
      curve segment. These curves can be represented by the following
      expressions:
      <UL>
	<LI> $\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{p}_0B_{0,1}(t) + \mathbf{p}_1B_{1,1}(t)$
	  for linear segments,
	<LI> $\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{p}_0B_{0,2}(t) + \mathbf{p}_1B_{1,2}(t)
	  + \mathbf{p}_2B_{2,2}(t)$
	  for quadratic segments,
	<LI> $\mathbf{p}(t) = \mathbf{p}_0B_{0,3}(t) + \mathbf{p}_1B_{1,3}(t)
	  + \mathbf{p}_2B_{2,3}(t) + \mathbf{p}_3B_{3,3}(t)$
	  for cubic segments,
      </UL>
      where <STRONG>p</STRONG><sub>0</sub>, <STRONG>p</STRONG><sub>1</sub>,
      <STRONG>p</STRONG><sub>2</sub>, and <STRONG>p</STRONG><sub>3</sub> are
      control points,  $B_{i,n}(t)$ is a Bernstein polynomial defined
      by the equation
      $$ B_{i,n}(t) = \left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ i\end{array}\right)
      t^i(1-t)^{n-i}\ ,$$
      with <STRONG>p</STRONG>(t) and the control points represented by vectors.
    <P>
      If the X and Y components of $\mathbf{p}(t)$ are $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ (with
      an obvious generalization to more dimensions), then the distance between
      two points on a  segment is
      $$ d(t_1,t_2) = \int_{t=t1}^{t2}\sqrt{A(t)^2 + B(t)^2}\,dt$$
      where
      $$ \begin{eqnarray}
	A(t) &amp; = &amp; \frac{dx}{dt} \\
	B(t) &amp; = &amp; \frac{dy}{dt}
      \end{eqnarray} $$
      These derivatives can be computed by using the relation,
      $\frac{d}{dt}B_{i,n}(t) = n(B_{i-1,n-1}(t) - B_{i,n-1}(t))$
      with $B_{-1,n-1}(t) = B_{n,n-1}(t) = 0$.  This relation can be
      used to differentiate $x$ and $y$, representing the derivatives
      as polynomials using a B&eacute;zier basis and the derivatives
      can then be easily transformed to a monomial basis.
    <P>
      Because $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are squared, the square root will
      always be positive unless $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ share a common
      root.  In addition, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ can be at most quadratic
      polynomials.   When $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ share at least one root,
      we can write the integral as
      $$ d(t_1,t_2) = \int_{t=t1}^{t2}|P(t)|\sqrt{Q(t)}\,dt$$
      where P(t) and Q(t) are polynomials and where the degree of
      $Q$ is either 2 or 0.
      
      <H2><A ID="linear"></A> Straight line segments</H2>
    <P>
      For linear line segments, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are constants and
      the integral is trivial:the length of a line segment is a
      constant multiplied by $t_2 - t_1$, with positive values
      indicating that the path parameter is increasing and negative
      values indicating that the path parameter is decreasing.

      <H2><A ID="quadratic"></A>Quadratic line segments</H2>
    <P>
      For quadratic line segments, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ are constants or
      first degree polynomials.  If $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ have a common
      root, the integrand is the absolute value of a
      polynomial. Otherwise, the integral can be written as
      $$ d(t_1, t_2) = \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{a + bt + ct^2}\,dt$$
      That integral can be found in the CRC Standard Mathematical
      Tables, which states that it is
      $$ d(t_1,t_2) = \left. \frac{(2ct+b)\sqrt{X}}{4c}
      \right|_{t=t_1}^{t_2} + \frac{1}{2k}\int_{t=t_1}^{t_2}\frac{1}{
      \sqrt{X}}\,dt$$
      where $q = 4ac-b^2$, $k = \frac{4c}{q}$ and $X = a + bt + ct^2$
      In addition,
      $\int_{t=t_1}^{t_2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{X}}\,dt$ has different values for
      <UL>
	<LI> $c &gt; 0$, in which case
	  $$\int \frac{dt}{\sqrt{X}} = \frac1{\sqrt{c}}
	  \log (\sqrt{X} + t\sqrt{c} + \frac{b}{2/sqrt{c}}) $$
	<LI> $c &gt; 0$ and $q &gt; 0$, in which case
	  $$\int \frac{dt}{\sqrt{X}} = \frac1{\sqrt{c}}
	  \sinh^{-1} \left(\frac{2ct+b}{\sqrt{4ac-b^2}}\right) $$
	<LI> $c &lt 0$, in which case
	  $$\int \frac{dt}{\sqrt{X}} = \frac1{\sqrt{-c}}
	  \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{-2ct-b}{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}\right) $$
      </UL>
      For $d(t_1,t_2)$, there are a few special cases.  If $q = 0$, the
      integral reduces to the integral of the absolute value of a
      first degree polynomial and that is a good approximation when q
      is very close to zero as well.  Also, when $|c|$ is sufficiently
      small, one can change the integral to
      $$ \begin{eqnarray}d(t_1,t_2) &amp; = &amp; \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2} \sqrt{a+bt}
      \sqrt{1 +\frac{ct^2}{a+bt}}\,dt \\
      &amp; \approx &amp; \int_{t=t_1}^{t_2}\left[
       \sqrt{a+bt} + \frac{ct^2}{2\sqrt{a+bt}}
      \right]\,dt
      \end{eqnarray}$$
      and both terms in the approximate value have integrals in the CRC
      Standard Mathematical Tables:
      $$\begin{eqnarray}
      \int \sqrt{a + bt}\,dt &amp; = &amp; \frac{2}{3b}\sqrt{(a+bt)^3} \\
      \int \frac{t^2}{\sqrt{a+bt}}\,dt &amp; = &amp;
           \frac{3(8a^2 - 4abt + 3b^2t^2)}{15b^3}\sqrt{a+bt}
        \end{eqnarray}$$
    <P>
      For integrals containing absolute values of polynomials, it is
      necessary to break the integral up into segments whose boundaries
      are the limits of integration and the roots, with no segment including
      a root internally. Finally, when the integral uses logarithms, it is
      possible for $a+bt+ct^2$ to be positive for $t\in[t_1,t_2]$ and the
      argument for the logarithm to be negative.  For this case
      use $\log x = \log (-x) + i\pi$ for $x &lt; 0$. While the integral is
      a complex number, the imaginary part is a constant and thus drops out
      of definite integrals.
      
      <H2><A ID="cubic"></A>Cubic line segments</H2>
    <P>
      For cubic line segments, $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ could be constants or
      first degree polynomials, but are typically second degree
      polynomials If $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ have a common root, the
      integrand is the square root of a constant or a second degree
      polynomial $Q(t)$, multiplied by the absolute value of a polynomial
      $P(t)$. There are three cases:
      <OL>
	<LI> if $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ share one common root, $P(t)$ is a first
	  degree polynomial and $Q(t)$ is a second degree polynomial
	<LI> if $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ share two roots or both have the same
	  double root, then $P(t)$ is a second-degree polynomial and
	  $Q(t)$ is a constant.
	<LI> If there are no roots in common, $A(t)^2 + B(t)^2$ is a
	  fourth degree polynomial with no real roots, and can be
	  factored into two polynomials $Q_1(t)$ and $(Q_2(t)$ that
	  have no real roots and that have positive values for all values
	  of $t$.
      </OL>
      Cases 1 and 2 involve integrals that are listed in the CRC
      Standard Mathematical Tables, and use elementary
      functions. While each has several cases, these are similar to
      the ones outlines in the section for <A HREF="#quadratic">the
	quadratic case</A>.
      One additional integral is useful:
      $$ \int x\sqrt{X}\,dt = \frac{X\sqrt{X}}{3c}
        - \frac{b}{2c}\int\sqrt{X}\,dt$$
      where $X = a + bt + ct^2$. This integral can be used for the case
      where $A(t)$ and $B(t)$ have on common root, in which case the
      integral is that for the absolute value of a first degree polynomial
      multiplied by the square root of a quadratic polynomial.
    <P>
      The third case, which requires integrating the square root of
      a quartic polynomial, uses elliptic integrals. If $Q_1(t)$ and
      $Q_2(t)$ are written as
      $$\begin{eqnarray}
      Q_1(t) &amp; = &amp; f_1 + g_1t+h_1t^2 \\
      Q_2(t) &amp; = &amp; f_2 + g_2t + h_2t^2 \ ,
      \end{eqnarray}$$
      the integral can be found in B.C. Carlson,
      "<A HREF="https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1992-59-199/S0025-5718-1992-1134720-4/S0025-5718-1992-1134720-4.pdf">

      Mathematics of Computation, Volume 59, Number 199, July 1992,
      Pages 165&mdash;180. Equation 2.45 on Page 169, labeled as
      [1, 1, 1, 1], contains this integral, and makes use of a number of
      variables Carlson defined before Equation 2.45. One obtains
      $$\begin{eqnarray}
      \int_{t=y}^{x}\sqrt{Q_1(t)Q_2(t)}\,dt &amp; = &amp;
                 (\delta^2_{22}/h_2^2 - \delta_{11}^2/h_1^2)[\psi_0H_0
                 + (\Delta_0 - \delta_{12}^2)R_f]/8 \\

      \end{eqnarray}$$
      where the quantities in this integral are defined below. In the following
      list of definitions, $i$ has each of two values (1 and 2) and the
      functions $R_F$, $R_J$, $R_C$, and $R_D$ are the Carlson symmetric

    <P>
      An algorithm for factoring $Q(t)$ is described
      in Brookfield, 
      "<A HREF="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Brookfield2007-103574.pdf">
	Factoring Quartic Polynomials: A Lost Art</A>",
      Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 80, No. 1, February 2007, Pages 67&ndash;70.
      The easiest way to proceed is to factor $Q(t)$ into three terms:
      a constant, and two quadratic polynomials whose $t^2$ coefficients are
      1.0. There are two special cases.
      <OL>
	<LI> the minimum value of at least one of the two factors is
	  small (e.g., less than $1 \times 10^{-4}$). In this case,
	  tests indicate that numerical accuracy is poor, and one should
	  use some other method such as numeric integration.
	<LI> the two factors are identical.  In this case, the integrand
	  is the absolute value of a quadratic polynomial. For this case,
	  the integral given in Carlson's paper can fail: a Java implementation
	  returned Double.NaN, most likely because of division by zero,
	  which suggests that Carlson's integral may not be numerically
	  accurate when the two factors are nearly, but not exactly
	  identical.
      </OL>
      When the two factors are nearly identical (for example, when the
      coefficients differ by less than $10^{-7}$), one can write
      $$ \begin{eqnarray}
      \sqrt{Q_1(t)Q_2(t)} &amp; = &amp; Q_1(t)\sqrt{\frac{Q_2(t)}{Q_1(t)}}
       =  Q_1(t)\sqrt{1 + \frac{Q_2(t)}{Q_1(t)} - 1} \\
      &amp; \approx &amp; Q_1(t)\left[1 + \frac12 (\frac{Q_2(t)}{Q_1(t)} - 1)
      \right]
      = \frac{Q_1(t) + Q_2(t)}{2}
      \end{eqnarray}$$
      and the integral can be approximated by the integral of a polynomial.
