  <H1>The BZDev class library and applications</H1>
  <P>
    The BZDev class library supports discrete-event simulation, graphs
    and plotting, mathematical functions and numerical algorithms, 2D
    animation, 3D printing, writing graphics to output streams,
    integration of scripting with applications, additional Swing
    components, etc.  This library, and several applications that use
    it, can be installed by visiting
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <A HREF= "https://billzaumen.github.io/bzdev/">

    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    and following the instructions provided there.  The location of
    the Debian repository is temporary&mdash;it is provided for
    initial use with a presumably small number of users.
  <P>
    The library uses &apos;factory&apos; classes for
    configuring simulations and animations. Annotation processor makes
    it relatively easy to create a factory class and provide support
    for dynamic methods in which the types of a method&apos;s
    arguments are determined at run time instead of compile time.  It
    also provides a Java-specific scripting language
    (<STRONG>ESP</STRONG>&mdash;Expression Sequence Processor) that
    can be used to run simulations and animations.  It also provides
    an implementation of a secure authentication algorithm called
    <A HREF="SecureBasic.html">Secure Basic Authentication</A> for use
    with web servers.
  <P>
    The library is provided as a series of Java modules, each with its
    own JAR file.  The source code is available on GitHub:

  <P>
    All of the module and package names start with
    <CODE>org.bzdev</CODE>, which was chosen mainly for brevity.
  <P>
    There are also several applications and additional class libraries
    based on the BZDev class library.  The more complex applications have
    web pages describing them. The libraries do not as the API documentation
    can be downloaded as part of an installation.
    These applications and libraries include

	The current package includes a stripped-down copy of Apache
	Batik because of an issue with Java modules: the Batik code
	duplicated some XML-related classes from packages whose names
	start with org.w3c and those classes cause a conflict that
	prevents the use of the standard Batik JAR files as Java
	automatic modules.  When that issue is resolved, libosgbatik
	will be modified so that it just contains the classes specific

	a car accident where an animation would help describe the situation
	(the author wrote it after being involved in a "fender bender" caused
	by an aggressive drive trying to pass by using a shoulder while the
	author was making a right turn from a right-turn-only lane onto a

    <H2> Short utility programs </H2>

    There are several (currently 1) short programs provided as JAR
    files, intended primarily for debugging, that can be downloaded.
    The <A HREF= "https://billzaumen.github.io/bzdev/">BZDev class library</A>
    has to be installed before these can be used.
    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="utils/transfertest.jar">transfertest.jar</A>. This
	will provide a console with a drop location near the top of
	a window.  If you drag and drop objects to that location, information
	about the data flavors the transfer provides will be displayed and
	may be saved to a file or printed.
	In the same directory in which <CODE>transfertest.jar</CODE> is
	placed, run the command
	<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
ln -s /usr/share/bzdev/libbzdev-desktop.jar .
	</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	To run the utility, use
	<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
java -jar transfertest.jar
	</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
or
	<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>
java -jar transfertest.jar default
	</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
	The output can be printed or saved in a file.  The 'default'
	option changes the text field representing the drop location
	to an uneditable text field and replaces its transfer handler.
	Without this option, new text may appear in the text field when
	a drag and drop operation completes.

    system stores the JAR files in different locations. The source code

    Besides providing a name, the adjacent figure shows an orbit
    around a black hole (no electric charge and not spinning), with
    color changes denoting redshifts due to both the relativistic
    Doppler effect and time running at different rates at various
    distances from the center.  It was produced by using the
    BZDev class library to

      <LI> solve differential equations numerically and use splines
	to represent the solutions.
      <LI> compute colors given a wavelength for a monochromatic
	light source.
      <LI> draw the image while expressing positions in units suitable
	to the problem domain (as opposed to pixels on a screen our output
	device).

    <H2>About this web page</H2>
  <P>
    Readers may find the design kind of "old fashioned" as it uses
    hand-written HTML with a style sheet to control the layout,
    font-sizes, colors, etc.  It was designed to load quickly (only a
    single, small image), and to be fully usable with a small screen
    width. That's useful if you are using an adjacent terminal window.
